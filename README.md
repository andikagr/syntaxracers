## Description

Syntax Racers is a web-based typing game designed specifically for developers. Unlike traditional typing tests that use random words or sentences, Syntax Racers challenges you to type actual code snippets. This helps improve your muscle memory for special characters, indentation, and syntax patterns common in programming.

## Features

-   **Multi-Language Support**: Practice typing in:
    -   JavaScript
    -   Python
    -   CSS
    -   Java
    -   C#
    -   PHP
    -   C++
-   **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Easy, Medium, Hard, and Master levels to match your skill.
-   **Custom Durations**: Race against the clock in 15s, 30s, or 60s sessions.
-   **Real-time Stats**: Track your WPM (Words Per Minute) and time remaining as you type.
-   **Syntax Highlighting**: Beautiful code rendering powered by [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/).
-   **Modern UI**: Sleek, glassmorphism-inspired design for a focused experience.

## How to Play

1.  **Select your preferences**: Choose your programming language, duration, and difficulty level from the main menu.
2.  **Start the Race**: Click the "START RACE" button.
3.  **Type the Code**: Type the code snippet shown on the screen exactly as it appears.
    -   **Green**: Correct character.
    -   **Red**: Incorrect character.
4.  **Finish**: When the time runs out, view your detailed results including final WPM and accuracy.

## Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/syntax-racers.git
    ```
2.  **Open the project**:
    Navigate to the project folder and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
